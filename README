dbi
===  database interface commands for Tcl
     by Peter De Rijk (Universiteit Antwerpen) 

What is dbi
-----------

The dbi interface is a generic Tcl interface for accessing different SQL databases.
It presents a generic api to open, query, and change databases.
The dbi package contains the definition of the dbi interface, and some tools.

Installation
------------
You should be able to obtain the latest version of dbi via www on url
http://tcl-dbi.sourceforge.net/

Compiled packages should be created using the following steps in the package directory:
(You can also build in any other directory, if you change the path to the configure command)
./configure
make
make install

Some of the make targets (such as install) need a working Tcl, and a package called pkgtools,
also available from http://tcl-dbi.sourceforge.net/

The configure command has several options that can be examined using
/configure --help

The dbi package contains directories with interfaces to several databases. The
ones you need should also be compiled in a similar way to the basic dbi package

How to contact me
-----------------
I will do my best to reply as fast as I can to any problems, etc.
However, the development of dbi is not my only task,
which is why my response might not be always as fast as you would
like.
