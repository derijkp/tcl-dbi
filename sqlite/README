dbi_sqlite
=============  dbi for sqlite
               by Peter De Rijk (Universiteit Antwerpen) 

What is dbi_sqlite
---------------------

dbi is a generic SQL database interface for Tcl.
dbi_sqlite is an implementation of the dbi interface for connecting to sqlite.
Invoking "package require dbi_sqlite" will make the command dbi_sqlite available.
With this command, objects can be created that can connect to an sqlite database and
that support the dbi interface.


Installation
------------
You should be able to obtain the latest version of dbi via www on url
http://rrna.uia.ac.be/dbi/.

Usually you can build the binaries and install the package using the following steps:
cd to the dbi directory
cd build
./configure
make install

The configure command has several options that can be examined using
/configure --help
eg. the option --disable-stubs can be used to build the extension for a version of 
Tcl that does not support stubs.

How to contact me
-----------------
I will do my best to reply as fast as I can to any problems, etc.
However, the development of dbi is not my only task,
which is why my response might not be always as fast as you would
like.
